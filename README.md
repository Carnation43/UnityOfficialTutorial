做游戏是我的梦想，即使困难重重。

### Prototype 1

#### Features: 
- Allow the player to press a key on the keyboard to switch camera views.
- Transform this into a "local multiplayer" spilt-screen game with two cars where one car is controlled by WASD and the other is controlled by the arrow keys.

#### Display:
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center">
<img src="media/Prototype_1.gif" alt="示例图01">
</div>

#### Notes:
▲ Replace <b>Update()</b> with <b>LateUpdate()</b> to prevent the jittering camera as the car drives down the road.
